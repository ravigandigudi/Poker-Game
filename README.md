This application is built using python and one can play a poker game of 5 cards which will give a score based on the types of cards you get. Intially, the player will have 5 cards with them, after that it will give an option to either hold those cards or replace them. To replace the cards just type which card numbers you want to replace in the terminal Each round cost is 5 points which will be taken out of the total points Initially, the player will have 100 points to start with.

If there are no such cards the application will say "You had bad cards, no points for these cards." and the player will have no points for that round.

I have added base cases for the game, if the player reaches 0 points, they cannot continue to play the game, also if the player reaches 2500 points which is the maximum points, the game terminates.

The application will terminate if the player types "exit" in the console.
